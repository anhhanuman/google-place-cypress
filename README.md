## **Testing strategy**
- Grab the requirement thoroughly and analise it via Postman
- Design manual test cases after get results from Postman
- Design automation test by using the best practice Page Object Modal design pattern for easier maintenance and clean code
- Run automation test via single command, see results visually in headless mode or browser mode
- Integrate to CI/CD

## **Technology stacks**
- **POSTMAN** : Using for sending requests and receive response manually
- **CYPRESS.IO**: Using for design and execute test cases automatically. Why using CYPRESS? Because it can be used for both UI and API automation
- **Github Actions
